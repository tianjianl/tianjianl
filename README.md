### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Tianjian Li, currently in Beijing working as an intern at Baidu Maps.  
  
My research interests mainly concern representation learning in graphs, 
especially using graph neural networks to enhance the performace of traffic planning and forecasting models.  

My other fields of interest include representation learning & knowledge discovery in natural language processing and recommendation systems.  

I am also an amateur Go(the chess, not the programming language) player, a veteran M:TG player(current rank #1070), and a San Antonio Spurs Fan since 2011.  

If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: litianjian98@google.com
