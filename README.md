### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Tianjian Li. I have received my B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from New York University. I am now pursuing a M.S. degree at Johns Hopkins University. 

I am currently doing research on cross-lingual transfer under the supervision of Prof. [Kenton Murray](https://kentonmurray.com/). My research interests mainly span natural language processing and deep learning. Currently focusing on NLP under multilingual settings, I aim answer these two questions:

- How to build practical multilingual NLP systems with limited training data and computational resources?
- How to interpret multilingual representations and make model predictions more robust? 

Previously, I was working as a research intern at the Knowledge Engineering Group of Tsinghua University, under the supervision of Prof. [Jie Tang](http://keg.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/jietang/). I have built a 1B multilingual language model mGLM, which excels in multilingual generation tasks due to its autoregressive denoising pre-train objective. mGLM is now [open sourced](https://github.com/THUDM/Multilingual-GLM) and feel free to use it! We have also built a [cross-lingual summarizer](https://models.aminer.cn/mglm-1b/demo/) that takes a piece of text in any langauge and outputs a short summary in Chinese and English. 

Before that, I have worked on Graph Neural Networks and its applications on [spatio-temporal forecasting](https://github.com/tianjianl/JamSTGCN) at Baidu Maps. 

There is a list of wonderful CS courses for self studying as well as my study notes under [this repository](https://github.com/tianjianl/studymaterials), which I will try to update regularly. 

I enjoy watching old movies as well as spending time with the nature during my spare time. 
If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: tli104@jhu.edu
