### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Tianjian Li, currently in Beijing working as an machine learning engineer intern at Baidu Maps.  
  
My research interests mainly concern representation learning in non-Euclidean structures, 
especially using graph neural networks to enhance the performace of traffic planning and forecasting models.  

My other fields of interest include recommending systems, knowledge graphs and information retrieval.  

I am also an amateur Go(the chess, not the programming language) player and a San Antonio Spurs fan since 2011.  

If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: tl2387@nyu.edu
