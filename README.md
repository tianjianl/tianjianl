### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 
My name is Tianjian Li, currently in Beijing working as an machine learning engineer intern at Baidu Maps. 
  
My research interests mainly concern representation learning in non-Euclidean structures, 
especially using graph neural networks to enhance the performace of spatial-temporal modeling

My other fields of interest include recommender systems, information retrieval and the robustness of graph neural networks.  

I am also an amateur Go(the chess, not the programming language) player and a San Antonio Spurs fan since 2011.  



[Here](https://github.com/truthbutcher/studymaterials/blob/main/CV_Tianjian_2022_Homepage.pdf) is my CV. If you have anything to share with me, please feel free to contact me through my email: tl2387@nyu.edu
